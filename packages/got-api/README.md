To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

# Getting Started

-   Make sure all dependencies are built
-   SST is now available via the sst package `bunx sst`
-   We now have commands to operate on the `dev` stage like `bun run dev:deploy`
-   When setting up first, make sure to run `bun run dev:refresh` to get the currently deployed stack
-   run `bun run dev:deploy` to deploy to the development stage
